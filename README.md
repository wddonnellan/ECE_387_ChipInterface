To compile using compile_scrpit.py simply plug in an arduino uno board to your computer and find the com port in the arduino IDE and then edit line 25 'com3' and replace it with the com port of your arduino uno

For wiring see the wiki section for a written description and links to wiring diagrams for both the arduino uno and barebones atmega328p chip
